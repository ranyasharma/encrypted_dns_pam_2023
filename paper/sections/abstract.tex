Unencrypted DNS traffic between users and DNS resolvers can lead to privacy and security concerns. In response to these privacy risks, many browser vendors have deployed DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to encrypt queries between users and DNS resolvers. Today, many client-side deployments of DoH, particularly in browsers, select between only a few resolvers, despite the fact that many more encrypted DNS resolvers are deployed in practice.

In this paper, we explore the performance of a large group of encrypted DNS resolvers supporting DoH by measuring DNS query response times from global vantage points in North America, Europe, and Asia. Our results show that many non-mainstream resolvers have higher response times than mainstream resolvers, particularly for non-mainstream resolvers that are queried from more distant vantage points---suggesting that most encrypted DNS resolvers are not replicated or anycast. In some cases, however, certain non-mainstream resolvers perform at least as well as mainstream resolvers, suggesting that users may be able to use a broader set of encrypted DNS resolvers than those that are available in current browser configurations.
