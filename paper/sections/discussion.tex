These findings highlight promising advancements and areas for further development. 
Mainstream DoH deployments deployments by major browser vendors have evidently established a robust encrypted DNS infrastructure, with strong performance,
offering improved privacy and security.  
However, the broader ecosystem of non-mainstream encrypted DNS resolvers presents a more nuanced picture. 
Although these alternative resolvers offer greater diversity, they oftentimes suffer from slower response times, except for a few cases, particularly when they are not locally based. 
This underscores the challenges associated with ensuring global availability and consistent quality across the encrypted DNS landscape, while ensuring that queries are distributed across multiple encrypted resolvers.
Note that the presence of high-performing non-mainstream resolvers is promising and encouraging. These show that lesser-known providers can achieve similar reliability to mainstream resolvers, offering
users alternative choices. 

Overall, the encrypted DNS ecosystem should be expanded to include more globally distributed, high-performing alternatives that are operated by a broader range of organizations. 
This diversification is necessary to enhance user privacy and avoid the over-reliance on a handful of popular vendors.
